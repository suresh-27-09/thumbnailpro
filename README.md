# Thumbnail Creator

This is a simple Python project that makes thumbnails for all images in a folder.  

## What it does

- Looks inside a folder called img /for images  
- Makes smaller versions (thumbnails) of size 200x200 pixels  
- Saves them in a folder called output/
- Works with these formats: jpg, jpeg, png, bmp, tiff, webp 
- Uses Python multiprocessing so it works faster  

## How to use

1. Make sure you have Python installed.  
2. Install the Pillow library:

pip install Pillow
Put your images inside the folder img/.

Run the program:
python main.py
Check the output/ folder for thumbnails.
